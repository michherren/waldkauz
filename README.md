This is a weekend-project to explore multi-arch builds and packaging in go. Waldkauz is a small wrapper around the awesome [Redpanda Console (formerly known as Kowl)](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console) Kafka-Client. The generated static binary includes everything needed to run console.

**important:** This is provided as is and only very limited testing was done!
