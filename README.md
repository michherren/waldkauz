This is a weekend-project to explore multi-arch builds and packaging in go. Waldkauz is a small wrapper around the awesome [Kowl](https://github.com/cloudhut/kowl) Kafka-Client. The generated static binary includes everything needed to run kowl.

**important:** This is provided as is and only very limited testing was done!

## Installation
